# Obsidian Asciinema cast file viewer plugin

This is a [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin which supports viewing [asciicast](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/blob/develop/doc/asciicast-v2.md) files.

This was originally based on [dkleinbe's plugin](https://github.com/dkleinbe/obsidian-asciinema-player), in turn based on [nekomeowww's plugin](https://github.com/nekomeowww/obsidian-asciinema-player)

Usage: Open a `.cast` file in Obsidian, and it will be rendered as an asciinema player.
